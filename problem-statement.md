# EV Charger Booking App

### Problem Statement:
We want to build a EV Charger Booking platform to allow a rider to book a chargepoint.

### Details:
* The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.
* Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
* Develop a solution for booking chargers for EVs.
* User can get a list of charging stations based on their location.
* Book a slot at any station
* Start charging
* End charging and get notified of the payment pending

Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.
* Register a rider.
* Register a driver/cab
* Update a cab's location
* A driver can switch on/off his availability
* A rider can book a cab
* Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider.
* End the Trip
